# IndexedList_DSA
ADT IndexedList â€“ represented using a Singly Linked List (SLL).

This project implements an Indexed List data structure in C++, which stores elements using a Singly Linked List (SLL) and provides efficient access to elements at specific indexes. The project includes both short and extended tests, as well as an iterator for traversing the elements.

Files in the Project
  - App.cpp: The main application file that demonstrates the usage of the IndexedList and tests its functionality.
  - ExtendedTest.cpp: Contains extended test cases to verify the correctness and performance of the IndexedList data structure.
  - ExtendedTest.h: Header file for the extended test cases, defining test functions for larger and edge cases.
  - ShortTest.cpp: Contains short test cases to check basic functionality and correctness of the IndexedList.
  - ShortTest.h: Header file for the short test cases, declaring functions to test basic operations on the IndexedList.
  - IndexedList.cpp: The implementation of the IndexedList class, which is backed by a Singly Linked List and allows efficient access by index.
  - IndexedList.h: Header file for the IndexedList class, providing declarations for its methods and attributes.
  - IndexedListIterator.cpp: Contains the implementation of the iterator for the IndexedList, which allows traversing over the elements of the list.
  - IndexedListIterator.h: Header file for the IndexedListIterator class, defining the interface for iterating through the elements of the IndexedList.

NOTE: The code for this project can be found on the master branch.
